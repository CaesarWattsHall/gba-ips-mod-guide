## ✨ Why I Built This

I completed this mod in about **3 hours**, using only beginner-friendly tools and a solderless IPS V2 screen kit.  
My goal was to restore a 20+ year-old handheld into something sleek, playable, and future-proof—with no more worm light!

This project taught me:
- How to plan and research a mod
- How to troubleshoot issues like stripped screws
- The importance of good documentation

Whether you’re a beginner or just GBA-curious—this guide is for you.
