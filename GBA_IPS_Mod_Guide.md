# How to Build an All-Black GameBoy Advance with an IPS V2 Screen (Using a 32-pin Motherboard)

## Introduction
This was my first time modding a GameBoy Advance, and it took me around **3 hours** to complete. I followed community guides, took my time with the delicate parts, and learned a lot in the process. The final result is a clean, modern build with an IPS screen and a striking all-black aesthetic‚Äîsomething that looks and feels premium, but still respects the original design.

## Parts & Tools I Used

### Core Components
1. **eXtremeRate IPS Ready Shell (Black-Black)**
2. **32-pin GBA Motherboard**
3. **2.9" Original-Size IPS High Brightness LCD (Black version)**
   - Comes with both 32-pin and 40-pin ribbon cables
   - I used the 32-pin for compatibility
4. **HD Screen Protection Film (Optional)**
   - Omitted in my build; the glass screen is already scratch-resistant

### Tools & Supplies
- Tri-wing screwdriver (be cautious‚Äîsee below)
- Phillips screwdriver
- Isopropyl alcohol (for cleaning *only* the motherboard)
- Microfiber cloth
- Cotton swabs
- Plastic pry tool
- Tweezers (optional)

## Screw Types & Notes
Understanding the screws before starting is crucial:

- **Motherboard**: 2 or 3 Phillips screws (depends on your board)
- **Metal Cartridge Tray**: 4 Phillips screws
- **Back Shell**: 6 Tri-wing screws
- **Battery Cover**: 1 Phillips screw

> The screws provided in the replacement shell aren‚Äôt as durable as the originals. Use gentle, precise turns‚Äîover-tightening can strip or bend them.

## Real-World Build Insight: What I Learned
One of the tri-wing screws that came with the shell bent while inside the groove. The grooves aren‚Äôt pre-threaded, which makes closing the shell a repetitive screw-unscrew process. It took me three tries and a lot of patience to extract the damaged screw. Thankfully, I had a spare tri-wing screw from another device that fit perfectly.

**Lesson learned:** Keep extras on hand, and don‚Äôt force shell closure. A poorly sealed shell allows dust inside and looks unfinished.

## Pre-Build Cleaning: A Must-Do
Before assembly, I cleaned my 32-pin motherboard with isopropyl alcohol. Areas I cleaned:
- Button contact pads (gold/brass)
- Battery contact points
- Power switch
- Cartridge slot
- Speaker contacts

> **Do not** clean the buttons or screen with alcohol‚Äîit can damage rubber parts and surface coatings.

## Assembly Steps

1. **Disassemble the Original GBA**
   - Remove screws and gently separate the shell
   - Extract the board, screen, and buttons

2. **Install IPS Screen**
   - Fit screen into new shell using adhesive bracket
   - Connect the correct ribbon cable for your motherboard type
   - Align the screen carefully

3. **Reassemble with the New Shell**
   - Add buttons, membranes, and motherboard
   - Install cartridge tray (4x Phillips screws)
   - Connect everything, screw it shut

4. **Test Your Mod**
   - Power on and verify screen, buttons, sound, and game reading

## Optional Modern Upgrade
**Rechargeable Li-ion Battery (1800mAh):**
- USB-C charging
- 5‚Äì8 hours playtime
- ~$30‚Äì$60 depending on seller
- I skipped this for my first build to stay under a $150 budget

## My Budget & Ordering Experience
All components were ordered from **AliExpress**, including:
- IPS screen
- Shell
- Tools & accessories

**Total cost:** ~$140 (with shipping & discounts)  
**Shipping time:** ~15 days  
**Packaging:** Secure with bubble wrap

## Conclusion
Modding this GBA was one of the most rewarding DIY projects I‚Äôve tackled. The IPS screen looks incredible, and the blacked-out build feels modern while keeping its nostalgic charm. This guide is meant to show that even first-timers can create something amazing with patience, the right tools, and a good walkthrough.

# FAQ: Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### Q: What if my screen doesn‚Äôt turn on?
**A:**  
- **Check Connections**: Ensure all ribbon cables are seated correctly.  
- **Power Supply**: Confirm the batteries are fresh or power is properly delivered.  
- **Polarity & Orientation**: Double-check connectors for reversal.  
- **Kit Instructions**: Some kits require specific jumper settings.  
- **Screen Testing**: Use a known-good system to test the display.

### Q: Can I use a 40-pin board with this kit?
**A:**  
Yes. Most modern IPS kits include both 32-pin and 40-pin ribbon cables. Just make sure your motherboard type matches the ribbon, and refer to your kit‚Äôs wiring diagram.

### Q: Is soldering necessary?
**A:**  
Not usually. Many IPS kits today are solderless. However, some optional features like brightness control may require light soldering. Choose kits labeled ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù for ease.

### Q: What flash carts do you recommend for reliable GBA gameplay?
**A:**  
The **EZ Flash Omega Definitive Edition** stands out for its UI, reliable save system, and ease of use. While I haven‚Äôt personally used it yet, it‚Äôs top of the list for future upgrades. Other flash carts may have clunky interfaces or unreliable save handling.
